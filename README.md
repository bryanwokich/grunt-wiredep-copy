# grunt-wiredep-copy

> Copies dependencies managed by wiredep

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out
the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains
how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as
install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may
install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-wiredep-copy --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile
with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-wiredep-copy');
```

## The "wiredepCopy" task

### Overview

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `wiredepCopy` to the data
object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  wiredepCopy: {
    target: {
      options: {
        src: 'app',
        dest: 'dest',
        wiredep: {}
      }
    },
  },
})
```

### Options

#### options.src

Type: `String`
Default value: `.`

The directory containing the wiredep target.

#### options.dest

Type: `String`
Default value: `.`

The destination directory to copy Bower dependencies to.

#### options.wiredep
